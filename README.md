# Seer Site

A website to share, find, rate, and comment on landmarks near you!

This is a small website made for the purposes of practicing with Node.js, Express, and Mongo. React may be integrated in future, to round it out as a full MERN stack application.

A live version of the site can be found here:
[Seer Site - Hosted by Render](https://seer-site.onrender.com/)

Cloudinary, Mongo Atlas and Render are used as external services at the moment, this may change to a unified cloud provider soon.
